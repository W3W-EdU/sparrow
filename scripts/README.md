# Scripts

## Download and Installation

Use the `install_binary.sh` or `install_distribution.sh` scripts to download and install the sparrow binary on a machine.

`install_binary.sh` will download and extract the packed binary from GitHub.

`install_distribution.sh` will detect the systems distribution and installs the right version of the sparrow with the common package manager.

## Config

Use the `get_config.sh` script to download a remote startup configuration file.
Pass the sparrow name, the url where the config is located and the token that is needed for authentication.
The token will be used in the config for the sparrow registration and check configuration as well!
